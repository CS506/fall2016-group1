# Requirements Testability Metric

We define our metric for testability to be the percentage of detailed requirements 
that are testable. We will use three kinds of test methods in requirements testing 
(adapted from [Requirements Specification and Testing by Tor Stalhane](http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/tdt4242/foiler/3-2-Testability.ppt)):

* T – Tests. Input/output. Involves the computer system and peripherals.
* E – Experiments. Input/output but involves also the users.
* I – Inspections. Evaluation based on documents.

A requirement is testable if any of the above test methods can definitely validate 
that the requirement is operative in the finished product (Braude and Bernstein 340).
