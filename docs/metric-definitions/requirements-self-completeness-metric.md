# Requirements Self-Completeness Metric

We define self-completeness as a set of requirements that includes all the parts necessary for the parts that are already present. Measuring self-completeness involves examining each detailed requirement and taking note of any necessary associated requirement that is missing. The amount of self-completeness can be measured and improved using two questions that are mentioned in the book *Software Engineering, Modern Approaches 2nd Edition* written by Eric J. Braude, John Wily & Sons. 

* For each requirement stated, are all the requirements present that it refers to?
* For each requirement stated, are all the requirements present that it depends on?
