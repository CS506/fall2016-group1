# Requirements Testability Measurements

See requirements [testability metric definition](../metric-definitions/requirements-testability-metric.md) for a discussion of this metric.

## Summary of Results

* 38 detailed requirements total
* ***21 (55%) are testable***

## Complete Tabular Results

This table gives each detailed requirement of the baseline requirements. If the requirement is testable, we give a "T", "E", or "I" depending on the kind of test method appropriate.

Requirement number | Test method
--- | ---
1. | no
1.i. | E
1.ii. | T
2. | E
2.i | T
2.ii. | no
2.iii. | T
2.iv. | no
2.iv.a. | no
2.iv.b. | T
2.v. | no
2.v.a. | T
2.v.b. | no
2.vi. | no
2.vi.a. | T
2.vi.b. | T
3. |  E
3.i. |  T
3.ii. | T
3.ii.a. | T
3.ii.b. | no
3.ii.c. | T
3.ii.d. | T
4.i.a.a. | T
4.i.a.b. | no
4.i.b.a. | no
4.i.b.b. | no

4.ii.c. | T


## Observations

* Many of the non-testable requirements are just too vague to be tested. However, some of these non-testable requirements are broken down into more detailed requirements that *are* testable. Perhaps we should consider "redefining" what we mean by a *requirement*. Perhaps we should consider a single requirement to be more than just a single bullet point?
