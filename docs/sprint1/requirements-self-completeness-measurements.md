# Requirements Self-Completeness Measurements

We define self-completeness as a set of requirements that includes all the parts necessary for the parts that are already present. Measuring self-completeness involves examining each detailed requirement and taking note of any necessary associated requirement that is missing. The amount of self-completeness can be measured and improved using two questions that are mentioned in the book *Software Engineering, Modern Approaches 2nd Edition* written by Eric J. Braude, John Wily & Sons. 

* For each requirement stated, are all the requirements present that it refers to?
* For each requirement stated, are all the requirements present that it depends on?


## Summary of Results

* 40 detailed requirements total
* ***40 (100%) are self-complete***

## Complete Tabular Results

This table gives each detailed requirement of the baseline requirements. For the given requirement, it will only be self-complete if all requirements present that it refers to and that it depends on.

## Observations

* Our detailed requirements are self-complete across the board. Our set of requirements was carefully engineered to include all parts that would be required by each requirement. The requirements had all the requirements it refered to, and also included all the requirements it depends on.  
* Going forward, we need to continue to be diligent to maintain our success in self-completeness. Making sure to include all the parts as we move along the process will become more critical to our success.
