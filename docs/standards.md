# Standards

Here are some standards we expect each member of the group to adhere to while working on the project.

**Design artifacts:**
* All design artifacts shall contain a title in the top-center. The title shall contain both the *kind* of artifact (e.g. data flow model, state diagram, etc.) and the *feature* it is associated with (e.g. login). Both pieces of information shall also be included in the filename.
* All graphical design artifacts shall be exported as PDFs in their respective sprint directories. The original design artifacts (e.g. `.pptx` files) shall be saved in the `arhives` directory in the respective sprint directory. This will allow any member of the team to modify the design artifacts later.

**Filenames:**
* No filename shall contain spaces.
* All documentation files (i.e. files in the `docs` directory) shall be all lower-case with words separated by hyphens.
* All **controller**, **model**, and **router** filesnames shall be in UpperCamelCase without hyphens.
* All **view** filenames shall be all lower-case with words separated by hyphens.

**Implementation:**
* Indentation shall be 4 spaces.
* Nested blocks shall be properly indented (for both HTML and JavaScript).
* Source code shall be properly documented with comments *(to be defined as a team)*.
