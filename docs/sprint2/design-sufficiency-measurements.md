# Design Sufficiency Measurements 

See [design sufficiency metric definition](../metric-definitions/design-sufficiency-metric.md) for a discussion of this metric.

## Summary of Results

* Sufficiency assured by the design diagrams: 86%

## Complete Results

We organize our measurements based on the requirements provided in baselined-requirements.md. The first column lists the requirements considered in the sprint 1. The second column tells whether the requirements are covered by the design. The third column mentions the sufficiency percentage of the design diagram.

# Notes
1.	Percentages have been rounded off to the previous nearest integer.
2.	Total sufficiency of all the design diagrams is the average sufficiency percentage of each set of requirements.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following tables provide information about what are the requirements covered by our design models. The first column in every table tells the type of design diagram. The second column lists the requirements covered by the design.
