# Implementation Flexibility Measurements

See [implementation flexibility metric definition](../metric-definitions/implementation-flexibility-metric.md) for a discussion of this metric.


## Summary of Results

 * Number of methods: 12
 * Number of methods flexible: 12
 * ***Flexibility metric: 100% (See Observations)***

## Complete Results

The table below lists the degrees of each attribute, for each method in the implementation based on the above metrics.

Method | Comment lines(%) | Named constants(%) | Methods with unusual size(%) | Repeated code(%) | External variables(%) | Generic methods(%) | Variable and function names difficult to understand(%) | Flexibile?

## Observations

* We can see that some of the mertics are not completely satisfied but with careful observation of the implementation source code we can notice that the code is sufficiently flexible to changes within a desirable range.
* If the requirements undergo drastic changes then the implementation flexibility goes down drastically.
* There are some attributes, like the number of comment lines, which are present at appropriate places but not in high numbers. These attributes would have a low value based on the actual count but are sufficiently placed in order to account for flexibility in our opinion. We feel that there is no need to clutter the file with a lot of comments in order to explain trivial concepts.
* One area where we could improve is the named constants (Eg.: the status codes can be given meaningful names in order to facilitate easy understanding)
